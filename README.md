The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a large database of handwritten digits used for training image processing systems and machine learning models, especially in digit recognition tasks.

Key Features of MNIST Dataset
Contains: 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9)
60,000 images for training
10,000 images for testing
Image Size: 28x28 pixels
Format: Each image is a single-channel (grayscale) 28Ã—28 matrix, where pixel values range from 0 (black) to 255 (white).
Label: Each image has a corresponding label (0-9), indicating the digit it represents.
Why Use MNIST?
Standard benchmark for ML models in handwritten digit recognition.
Simple and easy to use for testing deep learning models, especially CNNs.
Used in research to compare different machine learning algorithms.
